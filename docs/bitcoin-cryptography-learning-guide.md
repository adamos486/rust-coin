## Learning Strategy

1. **Start with fundamentals**: Ensure you understand the basic mathematical concepts before diving into implementations.

2. **Learn by implementing**: For each cryptographic primitive, first understand the theory, then implement a simple version yourself, and finally compare with established libraries.

3. **Use test vectors**: Bitcoin Core and other projects provide test vectors for cryptographic operations. Use these to validate your implementations.

4. **Progressive complexity**: Begin with simpler aspects like hash functions before moving to more complex topics like elliptic curve cryptography.

5. **Practical application**: Always relate what you're learning back to how Bitcoin uses these cryptographic primitives.
